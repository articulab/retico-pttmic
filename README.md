[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/retico-pttmic/badge/?version=latest)](https://retico-pttmic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)

This repo includes a Push-To-Talk (PTT) Microphone Module, that sends audio IUS only when the `M` key is pressed. This Module can be
useful to prevent a Conversational Agent to hear itself and loop endlessly.

For others Retico repositories created by our team, Articulab from Inria Paris, please find 
them under our github organization : [github.com/articulab](https://github.com/articulab).
