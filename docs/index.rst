Welcome to retico-pttmic's documentation!
=======================================

Retico is a framework to build incremental and modular dialog systems.
Retico-pttmic provides push-to-talk capabilities to the classic retico MicrophoneModule
which captures audio signal from the microphone and chunks the audio signal into AudioIUs.
The addition of this module is the introduction of the push-to-talk capacity : 
the microphone's audio signal is captured only while the M key is pressed.
